1. First run app.py file 
First run app.py file. The file contains code for extract the title and 
content of a webpage using Python. You can use web 
scraping techniques to extract data from web pages. Web scraping 
involves extracting data from websites and saving it in a structured 
format. There are several libraries in Python that can help you with web 
scraping, such as Beautiful Soup. once you have installed Beautiful 
Soup, you can use it to extract the title and content of a webpage by 
finding the relevant HTML tags. You can use the requests library to get 
the HTML content of a webpage, and then pass it to Beautiful Soup to 
extract the relevant information. 
2. Run the extraction file 
perform natural language processing on the text data extracted from 
web pages. After scraping the web pages, you can use NLTK (Natural 
Language Toolkit) to remove stop words and perform other natural 
language processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech 
tagging, and lemmatization. 
Once you have processed the text data, you can use sentiment 
analysis techniques to find the positive and negative scores of the text. 
There are several libraries in Python that can help you with sentiment 
analysis, such as TextBlob and VADER. These libraries can help you 
determine the sentiment of the text and extract other parameters such 
as subjectivity and polarity. To store the output we have made just 
empty output data structure csv for storing all the value.
